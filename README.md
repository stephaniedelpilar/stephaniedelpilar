### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Business Manager at an Tech Consultancy Broker. 
-ðŸŒ± This summer IÂ´m planning to dust off my coding skills to eventually gain more experience and vaulable knowledge for the future.
-âš¡ Fun fact: I studied Web development 2015, had a parental leave break between Oct 2016 and Feb 2019. I got my diploma 2019 âœ¨

Looking forward to this journey! 

Cheers, Steph
